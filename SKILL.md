# Spectacular Transgression

A skill for designing brief, visual interventions in sacred or state spaces that create indelible images and provoke revealing responses.

## When to Use

- When traditional protest has become invisible or expected
- When the fusion of institutions (state, church, corporation) needs exposing
- When a single powerful image can say more than extended argument
- When you're willing to face serious consequences for the message

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Choose the Sacred Space

Identify locations where transgression is most meaningful:
- Religious sites that align with state power
- Government buildings during ceremonies
- Corporate headquarters during shareholder meetings
- Media events where cameras are already present

The space should embody what you're challenging. The transgression should make the fusion visible.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design the Image

Create a visual that needs no explanation:
- What will cameras capture in seconds?
- What will spread without context?
- What will remain in memory?
- What contrasts normal use with your intervention?

The image must work as still photograph and video clip. It must compress message into instant.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Plan for Brevity

You may have seconds or minutes:
- What can be accomplished in 30 seconds?
- What can be shouted in one line?
- What banner can be unfurled before removal?
- What action is complete the moment it begins?

Duration is not the goal. The image is the goal.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Ensure Documentation

The intervention only matters if captured:
- Your own camera operators in position
- Knowledge of where official cameras will be
- Multiple angles and backup recording
- Immediate transmission before confiscation

Assume all your equipment will be seized. Ensure footage is already elsewhere.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Prepare for Response

The response is part of the message:
- Accept that arrest is likely
- Prepare legal support
- Script public statements for after
- Plan how disproportionate response amplifies message

If they overreact, let them overreact in public.

## Output Format

A spectacular transgression plan including:
1. The message and why this intervention expresses it
2. Location selection and its significance
3. The image to be created
4. Timeline and brevity planning
5. Documentation strategy
6. Response preparation and legal readiness

## Constraints

- Safety of participants must be considered
- The transgression should not harm bystanders
- Violence defeats the purpose
- Legal consequences must be accepted, not evaded
- The space should genuinely embody the problem

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Expose the alliance between fossil fuel companies and government environmental agencies

**Output**:
"Space: The signing ceremony for a new 'environmental partnership' between the EPA and major oil companies. Image: Activists in matching EPA and oil company costumes exchange oversized prop money bags while holding a banner: 'PARTNERSHIP IN POLLUTION.' Timeline: 15-second intervention during photo opportunity. Documentation: Three camera operators at different angles, live-streaming to multiple platforms simultaneously. Press release sent the moment action begins. Response plan: Arrestees prepared with statement: 'We're being arrested for showing what's happening in plain sight.' Legal team standing by. The arrest becomes the second image: citizens handcuffed for naming corruption."

## Integration

Works with:
- **disproportionate-response**: Designed to provoke revealing overreaction
- **collective-action-design**: Can use collective structure for this type of action
- **image-bomb**: Similar visual intervention methodology
